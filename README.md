### Description

Add 4 buttons in the Properties>Output pannel

When your image sequence render is finished, just choose the quality and hit *"make video"*.
In the last version the resize option was replaced by an auto trigger tickbox, allowing to create the video automatically after the render.

Choose between 3 preset:
- Fast - fast encoding and light weight against quality (add "_L" suffix)
- normal - good quality, average weight and encoding time
- Final - slower - super quality and optimize weight (add "_F" suffix)
