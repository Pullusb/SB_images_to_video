### Description

Add buttons in the Properties > Output pannel

When your image sequence render is finished, just choose the quality and hit *"make video"*.  

`auto Launch` create the video automatically after the render ends

`Open at finish` will launch play of the video after encoding is done

Choose between 3 preset:

- _Fast_ - fast encoding and light weight against quality (add "_L" suffix)
- _normal_ - good quality, average weight and encoding time
- _Final_ - slower - super quality and optimize weight (add "_F" suffix)
